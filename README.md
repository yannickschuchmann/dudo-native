Missing functionality:

1.- TableList.js --> navigation, user experience: click (touch) listItem and go that Table game.
                     src/components/Management/TableList.js Line 86 has the onPress prop ready to be set up.
                     
2.- FridnsList.js --> review Search Logic to allow correct use of filtering the list of friends to find a particular friend.
                      src/components/Management/FriendsList.js Line 161 to 171 commented out search logic for review.
                      
3.- FridnsList.js --> Hook up ListItem (players) selection switches and reflect it on state to allow friend selection to                             create a table or to edit tables.
                      src/components/Management/FriendsList.js Line 203 ListItem switch onPress. Line 173 to 175 toggle logic.
                      
4.- PlayPicker.js --> Use the "Play" Button to submit the play and continue the game.
                      src/components/Game/Picker/PlayPicker.js line 21 to 27 is the button element.
